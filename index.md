I am a machine learning researcher and part of the inagural class of [Presidential Postdoctoral Fellows](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/04/08/twelve-scholars-named-princetons-first-presidential-postdoctoral-research-fellows) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) where I am mentored by [Naomi Leonard](http://www.princeton.edu/~naomi/).
I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Master's in Robotics at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) where I was supervised by [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). Prior to my graduate work, I completed Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering at [San Jose State University](https://www.sjsu.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, geometry and dynamical systems.
