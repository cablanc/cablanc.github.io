I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mae.princeton.edu/) and [Center for Statistics and Machine Learning](https://csml.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), and hold an affiliation with [Robotics at Princeton](https://robo.princeton.edu/). My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, geometry and dynamical systems.
 
Prior to my current appointment, I was part of the inaugural class of [Princeton Presidential Postdoctoral Fellows](https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/04/08/twelve-scholars-named-princetons-first-presidential-postdoctoral-research-fellows) and mentored by [Naomi Leonard](http://www.princeton.edu/~naomi/).
I completed my PhD in Computer Science and Master's in Robotics at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) where I was supervised by [Kostas Daniilidis](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~kostas/). Prior to my graduate work, I completed Bachelor's degrees in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering at [San Jose State University](https://www.sjsu.edu/).
